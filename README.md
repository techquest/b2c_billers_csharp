##### [Read our FAQs here](https://github.com/techquest/b2c-billers-java/wiki/FAQ)

### Biller  
A biller is any Organization/Institution/Business that is able to exchange services 
for a fee. e.g Telecoms provider(Airtel, Glo, MTN), Government Body(Lagos State) etc.

### Category  
Billers are grouped under categories. For instance, all cable providers(DSTV, GOTV) can e grouped under a `cable`
Category.

### Customer  
An individual that has an intent and/or pays for any of the services offered by a Biller.

### PaymentItem  
A biller(e.g DSTV) can offer different services and hence different prices for them.
Each of those services, falls under a payment-item and has a unique payment-item-code.
We say that a user has intent to pay for a payment-item offered by a Biller.
An example of a payment-item under DSTV is the `DSTV Premium Bouquet`
